The Texas Instruments TI-99/4A is a home computer, released June 1981 in the United States at a price of $525 ($1,366 adjusted for inflation). It is an enhanced version of the less successful TI-99/4 model, which was released in late 1979 at a price of $1,150 ($3,749 adjusted for inflation). The TI-99/4 had a calculator-style chiclet keyboard and a character set that lacked lowercase text. The TI-99/4A added an additional graphics mode, "lowercase" characters consisting of small capitals, and a full-travel keyboard. Both used 16-bit processors, making the TI-99/4 series the first 16-bit home computers.
