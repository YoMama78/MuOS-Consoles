An arcade game is a coin-operated (also bill-operated or card-operated) entertainment machine, usually installed in public businesses such as restaurants, public houses, and video arcades.
Arcade video games are often composed of short levels, intuitive control mechanisms and a rising difficulty. This is the main concept of an arcade video game in which the player is essentially obliged to pay to maintain the play.
