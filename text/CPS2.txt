The CP System II, also known as Capcom Play System 2[2] or CPS-2, is an arcade system board that Capcom first used in 1993 for Super Street Fighter II. It was the successor to their previous CP System, CP System Dash and Capcom Power System Changer arcade hardware and was succeeded by the CP System III hardware in 1996, of which the CPS-2 would outlive by over four years. The arcade system had new releases for it until the end of 2003, ending with Hyper Street Fighter II. Technical support for the CPS-2 ended on February 28, 2019.
