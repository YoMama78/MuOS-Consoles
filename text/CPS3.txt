The CP System III or CPS-3 is an arcade system board that was first used by Capcom in 1996 with the arcade game Red Earth. It was the second successor to the CP System arcade hardware, following the CP System II. The arcade system saw new releases up until mid 1999. Technical support for the CPS-3 ended on February 28, 2019. It would be the last proprietary system board Capcom would produce before moving on to the Dreamcast-based Naomi platform.
